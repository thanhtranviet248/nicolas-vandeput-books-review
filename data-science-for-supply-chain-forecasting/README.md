# Data Science For Supply Chain Forecasting

## About the book
Data Science For Supply Chain Forecasting by Nicolas Vandeput is a book that focuses on the application of data science techniques to improve demand forecasting and demand planning. It covers various forecasting methods, from traditional statistical approaches to advanced machine learning ones.

## About the repository
This repository stores my Python practices with techniques mentioned the book, including:
- Forecasting KPIs: Bias, Error, MAD, MAE, MAPE, MSE and RMSE.
- Statistical methods: Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing With Damped Trend, Triple Exponential Smoothing (Multiplicative) With Damped Trend, Triple Exponential Smoothing (Additive) With Damped Trend.
- Outlier cleaning.
- Statistical models optimization for Simple and Double Exponential Smoothing models.
- Machine Learning methods: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-means Clustering, Parameter Optimization with K-Fold Cross-Validation and RandomSearch, etc.

## Others
- I also write a summary and review of the book (in Vietnamese), you can find it with the file named "VNese_Book_Summary_And_Review.pdf".
- All the data used for Python programming are uploaded, including "norway_new_car_sales_by_make.csv" and "GDP.xlsx".
